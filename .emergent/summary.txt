The user wants to build a Finance Tracker mobile app for iOS/Android using React Native and Expo. Initially, they mentioned an existing FastAPI backend, but after inspection, it was found to be incomplete. Consequently, a new, full-featured FastAPI backend was developed from scratch in the current project environment. This new backend includes JWT authentication, CRUD operations for transactions, budgets, and goals, and an AI advice endpoint using OpenAI GPT-4 via the Emergent LLM Key.

The frontend was built using Expo Router, with screens for login/registration, a tab-based layout for a dashboard, transactions, budget, and settings. Zustand was used for state management.

A significant part of the trajectory involved connecting this new unified backend to the user's separate web app project. Since direct access was not possible, detailed API documentation and integration instructions were provided for the user to implement in the other project.

The focus then shifted to publishing the app. This involved an extensive and challenging troubleshooting process for An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username, fixing issues related to Node.js versions, bundle identifiers, missing assets, and dependency incompatibilities. While the Android build was successful, the iOS build consistently failed due to server-side network issues on the EAS platform.

The current work has pivoted to publishing the successful Android build on the Google Play Store. The AI is guiding the user step-by-step through the Google Play Console setup, including account verification and completing the required app information sections.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to create a cross-platform (iOS/Android) Finance Tracker mobile application using React Native (Expo).

**Core Features:**
- **Authentication:** Simple email and password registration/login.
- **Dashboard:** A central screen displaying financial summaries with charts (e.g., income vs. expense).
- **Transaction Management:** Ability to create, view, and delete income and expense transactions.
- **Budgeting:** Functionality to set and track budgets by category (e.g., monthly).
- **Savings Goals:** A feature to create and manage financial goals.
- **AI-Powered Advice:** An in-app feature to get financial advice generated by OpenAI's GPT-4, accessed via the Emergent LLM key.

**Technical Implementation:**
A new FastAPI backend with a MongoDB database was built to support all features. This backend is intended to be the single source of truth, serving both the new mobile app and the user's pre-existing web application. The mobile app is fully built with a tab-based navigation structure. The current primary objective is to publish the completed Android application to the Google Play Store.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, Expo Router (file-based routing), Zustand (state management), .
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB, Pydantic, Passlib (for password hashing), python-jose (for JWT).
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT-4 accessed through the Emergent LLM Key.
- **Deployment & CI/CD:** Expo Application Services (EAS) via  for building mobile apps, Git/GitHub for version control, and GitHub Pages for hosting the Privacy Policy.
- **App Stores:** Google Play Console for Android app submission.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo containing a  Expo app and a  FastAPI service.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files:**
- ****:
  - **Importance**: This is the complete, self-contained FastAPI backend. It defines all data models (Pydantic) and API endpoints for authentication (, ), transactions, budgets, goals, stats, and AI advice. It handles database interaction with MongoDB and JWT token generation/validation.
  - **Changes**: Created from scratch to be a feature-complete backend for both the mobile and web apps.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The main configuration file for the Expo app. It defines the app's name, slug, version, bundle identifiers, icon, and splash screen settings.
  - **Changes**: Heavily modified to set the app name to Finance Tracker, update the iOS  and Android  to the unique  to resolve an App Store conflict, and simplify the  configuration to fix a build error.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Configures the Expo Application Services (EAS) build process.
  - **Changes**: Created via An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Log in to EAS with email or username (exit and run eas login --help to see other login options)
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username. It was later modified to specify a fixed Node.js version () to resolve a dependency incompatibility during the cloud build. An attempt was made to set  to  to fix a memory issue, but was reverted as it requires a paid plan.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Defines the main tab bar navigation for the authenticated part of the app, using Expo Router's layout route concept. It sets up the tabs for Dashboard, Transactions, Budget, and Goals.
  - **Changes**: Created as part of the initial frontend scaffolding.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: A crucial file that manages the global authentication state (user token, user info) using Zustand. It provides an  and hooks () that other components use to access auth state and perform actions like login and logout.
  - **Changes**: Created from scratch to handle user session management.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: A static HTML file containing the app's privacy policy. This is a mandatory requirement for app store submission.
  - **Changes**: Created from scratch at the project root. It's hosted via GitHub Pages to provide a public URL for the Google Play Console.

<pending_tasks>
- Successfully build the iOS version of the application. This is currently blocked by intermittent network and server-side errors on the EAS platform.
- Complete the app submission process on the Google Play Console. This includes filling out the Target Audience and Content, Data Safety, and other required sections.
- Once the iOS build is successful, publish the app to the Apple App Store.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The development phase is complete. The current and immediate focus is on publishing the application to the app stores, starting with Android.

An Android build ( file) has been successfully created using EAS after overcoming numerous configuration and dependency issues. The user has also successfully created a Google Play Console developer account and paid the registration fee.

The immediate task is guiding the user through the App setup process on the Google Play Console. The user has navigated to the dashboard which lists all the required steps for submission. The process was started by creating and linking a  file hosted on GitHub Pages.

Currently, the AI is walking the user through the Content rating questionnaire. The user has just been shown a screenshot of the questionnaire and is asking for guidance on how to answer the questions presented. The process of filling out the store listing, data safety forms, and other required sections is still pending. The iOS build and publication are on hold due to persistent server-side build failures on EAS.
