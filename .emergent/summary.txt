The user, speaking Italian, requested a FinanceTracker mobile app using React Native (Expo) to connect to an existing FastAPI backend. Initial work involved scaffolding a complete full-stack application from scratch, including a new FastAPI backend with JWT authentication and all required CRUD endpoints (transactions, budgets, goals) plus an AI advice feature using an Emergent LLM key.

A significant architectural pivot occurred when the user wanted to sync data with their existing web app. Since accessing the old project's code was not possible, the agreed-upon solution was to use the newly created, superior backend as the single source of truth for both the mobile and web apps. I provided extensive documentation and a copy-pasteable guide for the user to update their other project.

The focus then shifted to publishing the app. This involved configuring  and , saving the project to a new GitHub repository, and guiding the user through setting up their local environment. We encountered and resolved a series of complex EAS Build errors related to app identifiers, Node.js versions, missing asset files, and dependency incompatibilities ().

Currently, the Android build is successful, but the iOS build is blocked by intermittent EAS server network errors. We are now in the process of publishing the completed Android build to the Google Play Store, guiding the user through the required submission forms.

The user's primary language is Italian. The next agent must respond in Italian.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build and publish a cross-platform (iOS/Android) FinanceTracker mobile application using React Native (Expo).

**Core Features Implemented:**
*   **Authentication:** Email/password registration and login using JWT.
*   **Dashboard:** Visual overview of finances with charts.
*   **Transaction Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for income and expense transactions.
*   **Budgeting:** Functionality to set and track budgets by category.
*   **Savings Goals:** Ability to create and contribute to savings goals.
*   **AI-Powered Advice:** A feature that provides financial advice using OpenAI GPT-4, accessed via the Emergent LLM Key.

**Architectural Requirement:**
The application was initially meant to connect to a pre-existing backend. However, a new, more complete backend was built instead. The final requirement is for this new backend () to serve as the single source of truth for both this mobile app and the user's separate web application.

**Publishing Goal:**
The application needs to be published to both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. The process for Android is currently underway.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, Expo Router (file-based routing),  for API calls.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB for the database.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing API endpoints.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT-4 accessed via the .
- **Deployment & Publishing:** EAS (Expo Application Services) Build for creating  (Android) and  (iOS) files, and GitHub Pages for hosting the static privacy policy file.
- **Local Development:**  to bypass local permission issues with global CLI tools.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo containing a  (Expo app) and a  (FastAPI server).



- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the complete, self-contained API for the application, handling all data logic and user authentication.
  - **Changes:** Created from scratch to provide all necessary endpoints for authentication, transactions, budgets, goals, stats, and AI advice.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main configuration file for the Expo app. It defines the app's name, bundle identifier, version, splash screen, icons, and other metadata required for building.
  - **Changes:** Heavily modified to set app name/slug, define unique  and  names () to fix build errors, and simplify the splash screen configuration to resolve a prebuild failure.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Configures the EAS Build process.
  - **Changes:** Created via An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Log in to EAS with email or username (exit and run eas login --help to see other login options)
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username. It was edited to specify a compatible Node.js version () to fix a dependency error during the cloud build. An attempt to use a  resource class was made but reverted as it's a paid feature.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Manages all frontend dependencies.
  - **Changes:** Updated multiple times. First, to add project dependencies. Later, env: load .env

- ****
  - **Importance:** A static HTML file required by the app stores for the privacy policy.
  - **Changes:** Created from scratch and placed in the project root. It is hosted for free using GitHub Pages, and its public URL was submitted to the Google Play Console.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Google Play Store Submission:** The user is currently filling out the submission forms. All sections (Store listing, Content rating, Target audience, Data safety) must be completed.
- **Publish to Apple App Store:** The iOS build is currently blocked by intermittent EAS server network errors. This needs to be re-attempted later. The user also needs to ensure their Apple Developer account is fully activated.
- **Update External Web App:** The user still needs to act on the provided instructions to update their separate web app project () to use the new backend API.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The primary focus is publishing the completed Android application to the Google Play Store. The Android build ( file) was successfully created using EAS Build after a lengthy debugging process.

We have moved to the Google Play Console, where the user has created an account and an app entry for Finance Tracker. We have successfully created and submitted the URL for the app's privacy policy, hosted on GitHub Pages.

Currently, the user is in the middle of filling out the **Content Rating questionnaire**. I have just guided them on how to correctly answer a series of questions related to the app's content, advising them to select No for questions about online content, promotions, location sharing, and digital goods. The immediate task is for the user to finish this questionnaire and save the progress so we can move to the next required section on the dashboard. The iOS build is on hold pending resolution of EAS server-side issues.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Guide the user to the next mandatory task on the Google Play Console dashboard, which is likely Pubblico di destinazione e contenuti (Target audience and content), after they confirm completion of the Classificazione contenuti questionnaire.
